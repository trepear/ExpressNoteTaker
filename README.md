# ExpressNoteTaker

This project utilized express in order to create an application that allows users to create notes and subsequently, delete them when they no longer need them.

## Challenges

Writing the "app.delete" was definitely the hardest part. I struggled to come up with a way to allow users to delete notes dynamically, but I ended up being able to do so using a ForLoop and the splice() method.
